      The 14th of November is celebrated as children's day. It is the birthday of
      Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru - the first Prime Minister of free India. It has
      an importance of its own. Pundit Nehru had a great love for children. He
      wanted to be among them, talk to them and play with them. The children

      and follow the footsteps of Pundit Nehru. They inspire them to deeds of
